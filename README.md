# Medical-Billing-System
A simple medical shop billing system built using C language in Turbo C
# 💊 Medical Billing System | C Language Project

A console-based Medical Shop Billing System developed using **C programming** and **file handling techniques** in Turbo C.  
This project simulates a simple billing system where users can manage medicine inventory, generate bills, and view stored items efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- ➕ Add medicine details to the database
- 🧾 Generate bills for purchased medicines
- 📄 View stored medicine records
- 💾 File handling for reading/writing data

---

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

1. Open **Turbo C** or any DOS-based C compiler (e.g., DOSBox)
2. Load the `billing.c` file into the compiler
3. Compile (`Alt + F9`) and run (`Ctrl + F9`) the program
4. Follow on-screen instructions to perform operations

> ⚠️ This program is designed for Turbo C and uses old-school DOS-based input/output. It may require adjustments to run on modern compilers like GCC.
